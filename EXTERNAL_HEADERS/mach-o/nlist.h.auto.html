 * For images created by the static link editor with the -twolevel_namespace

 * MH_TWOLEVEL.  And the binding of the undefined references of the image are
 * determined by the static link editor.  Which library an undefined symbol is
 * bound to is recorded by the static linker in the high 8 bits of the n_desc
 * field using the SET_LIBRARY_ORDINAL macro below.  The ordinal recorded
 * references the libraries listed in the Mach-O's LC_LOAD_DYLIB,
 * LC_LOAD_WEAK_DYLIB, LC_REEXPORT_DYLIB, LC_LOAD_UPWARD_DYLIB, and
 * LC_LAZY_LOAD_DYLIB, etc. load commands in the order they appear in the
 * headers.   The library ordinals start from 1.
 * For a dynamic library that is built as a two-level namespace image the
 * undefined references from module defined in another use the same nlist struct
 * an in that case SELF_LIBRARY_ORDINAL is used as the library ordinal.  For
 * defined symbols in all images they also must have the library ordinal set to
 * SELF_LIBRARY_ORDINAL.  The EXECUTABLE_ORDINAL refers to the executable
 * image for references from plugins that refer to the executable that loads
 * them.
 * 
 * The DYNAMIC_LOOKUP_ORDINAL is for undefined symbols in a two-level namespace
 * image that are looked up by the dynamic linker with flat namespace semantics.
 * This ordinal was added as a feature in Mac OS X 10.3 by reducing the
 * value of MAX_LIBRARY_ORDINAL by one.  So it is legal for existing binaries
 * or binaries built with older tools to have 0xfe (254) dynamic libraries.  In
